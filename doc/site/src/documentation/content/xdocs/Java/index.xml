      <title>Overview of the Java Library</title>
      <p>
	The &packagenamelong; &packageversion; supports
	<jump href="ext:w3c/xmldsig_java_supported">&supp_java_dsig;
	</jump> and 
	<jump href="ext:w3c/xmlenc_java_supported">&supp_java_enc;
	</jump>
      </p>
      <p>
	As of version 1.4, the Java library supports the standard Java API
	<jump href="http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/105.jsp">
	  JSR-105: XML Digital Signature APIs
	</jump> for creating and validating XML Signatures. A standard Java
	API for XML Encryption 
	<jump href="http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/106.jsp">
	  JSR-106: XML Digital Encryption APIs
	</jump> is in progress and is not final, so this
	API is not yet supported. You can continue to use the existing
	non-standard APIs in the Java Library (there are no plans
	to discontinue or deprecate them), but you should consider moving
	to the standard APIs.

      <title>JDK 1.4 issues</title>
      <p>
	If you use JDK 1.4 and want to use this software, be sure that Xalan is
	properly installed. Check the <jump
	  href="site:java/installation">installation guide</jump>!!!
      </p>
      <p>
	I have so many complaints from people who argue that the software
	throws exceptions during running the examples or during unit
	testing. This package NEEDS a Xalan version after 2.2D13 (and SUN
	shipped his JDK 1.4.0 final with a Xalan beta!). I started integrating
	the installation guide into the exception messages cause it seems that
	people don't have a look at the installation guide.
